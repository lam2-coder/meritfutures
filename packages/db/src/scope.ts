// THE REGISTRY IS DECLARED AND NEVER DERIVED, and that is the whole design.
//
// A mechanical "walk the foreign keys until something carries identity_id"
// derivation returns 25 of the 111 tables on this tree, and it is WRONG ON AT
// LEAST THREE of them:
//
//   treasury_balances.recorded_by -> users   scopes THE FIRM'S TREASURY to
//                                            whichever admin typed the
//                                            attestation.
//   impersonation_sessions.admin_user_id     reaches the ADMIN'S identity, not
//                                            the subject's.
//   sessions.device_fingerprint_id           reaches whoever SHARES A DEVICE.
//     -> identity_signals
//
// Auto-derivation here is not conservative, it is confidently wrong: each of
// those three produces a scoped query that RETURNS ROWS, for the wrong identity,
// with no error anywhere. So every rule below is written by a person and every
// one carries its reason.
//
// TOTALITY IS A COMPILE ERROR, NOT A TEST. `SCOPE_RULES` is declared against a
// mapped type over `TableKey`, so a table added to `schema.ts` without a rule
// here does not compile, and a rule naming a table that does not exist does not
// compile either. The unregistered table is unreachable through either accessor
// rather than reachable and unscoped.
